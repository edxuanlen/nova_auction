## **Introduction to Nova**

### **What does Nova do？**

We give users the reins to their yield. 

Nova is a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can sell their token points for earnings.

There are 2 main parts to fully understand Pendle:

1. Sell points for daily earnings
    You can provide ezETH on Nova, and Nova will auction the points generated by ezeth, with the proceeds distributed to all depositors. You can withdraw both the principal and any accrued earnings at any time after one day deposit.
    So，forget your points and earn ezETH everyday！

2. Obtain points through auction
    You can use ezETH to participate in the auctions for ezpoints and elpoints, allowing you to acquire a large number of points directly without holding ezETH for an extended period
