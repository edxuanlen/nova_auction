## **What is Nova?**

Nova is your gateway to maximizing your yield potential in the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance. We empower users by providing complete control over their yield, enabling them to thrive in both bullish and bearish markets. Nova is a groundbreaking, permissionless yield-trading protocol that allows users to sell their token points for earnings. Our innovative platform ensures that users can effortlessly optimize their returns with ease.

## **How Does Nova Work?**

### 1. Sell Points for Daily Earnings

With Nova, you can deposit ezETH, and our platform will auction off the points generated by your ezETH. The proceeds from these auctions are distributed among all depositors, providing you with consistent daily earnings. You can withdraw both your principal and any accrued earnings at any time after a one-day deposit. This means you can relax and watch your earnings grow daily with Nova.

### 2. Obtain Points through Auction

Alternatively, you can use ezETH to participate in auctions for ezpoints and elpoints. This allows you to acquire a significant number of points directly, without needing to hold ezETH for a prolonged period. By participating in these auctions, you can optimize your yield and increase your earnings potential.

# **Nova Auction: Unlock New Earning Opportunities**

## **Enabling Nova Auction**

To start participating in Nova Auction, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Activate Nova Auction:** Click the 'Auction' button on the app.

    ![](${Auction})

2.  **Choose Point Type:** Select the type of points you want to auction (you can auction ez points and el points on Nova).

    ![](${Bid})

## **How Nova Auction Works**
1. **Place Your Bid:** Once the auction starts, place your bid. Successful bids will earn you points.
2. **Blind Bidding System:** Nova Auction uses a blind bidding system, meaning you cannot see other participants' bids, and they cannot see yours. Confirm your bidding price and quantity, then proceed with the bidding.

## **Understanding Nova Auction**

You can auction ez points or el points with Nova Auction. Here's how it works:

- **Blind Bidding**: Submit your bid without knowing others' bids. This ensures a fair and competitive bidding process.
- **Winning and Refunds**: After the auction, the highest bidders win. The final transaction price is the lowest price among the successful bidders, and Nova will refund any excess amount.

### **Example Scenario:**

- Total Auction Units: 100 units
- Bidders:
  - A: Purchases 50 units at 0.2 ezETH per unit
  - B: Purchases 50 units at 0.1 ezETH per unit
  - C: Purchases 50 units at 0.05 ezETH per unit
- Results:
  - A wins the bid and receives a refund of 5 ezETH (50 units \* (0.2 - 0.1) ezETH).
  - B wins the bid.
  - C fails to win the bid and receives a refund of 2.5 ezETH (50 units \* 0.05 ezETH).

## **Why Choose Nova Auction?**

- **Fair and Transparent:** Enjoy a blind bidding system that ensures fairness and competitiveness.
- **Maximize Earnings:** Participate in auctions to earn points and enhance your yield.
- **User-Friendly**: Easily place bids and track your auction results within the app.
