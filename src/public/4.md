#### **About Nova Auction**

1. You can auction ez points or el points now.

2. The auction adopts blind bidding (you cannot know the bids of others, and likewise, others cannot know your bid).Confirm the bidding price and quantity, and proceed with the bidding.

3.  After the auction, the highest bidder wins. The final transaction price is the lowest price among the successful bidders, and Nova will refund the excess part.

For example, if the total auction is for 100 units, A purchases 50 units at a rate of 0.2 ezETH per unit, B purchases 50 units at a rate of 0.1 ezETH per unit, and C purchases 50 units at a rate of 0.05 ezETH per unit; A wins the bid and receives a refund of 5 ezETH (50 \* (0.2-0.1) ezETH), B wins the bid , while C fails in the bid and receives a refund of 2.5 ezETH (50 \* 0.05 ezETH).
